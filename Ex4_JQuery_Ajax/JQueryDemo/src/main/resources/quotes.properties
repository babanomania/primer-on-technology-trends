life=Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
dream=A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality
happiness=When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life
friendship=Count your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears
